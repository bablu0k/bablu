  <h1>Hey!</h1>
  <p>
    I guess you are here cause you wanna learn something from me?, i hope
    so... anyway have a quick read about me and my personal goal here..
  </p>
  <p>
    I like teaching stuff, though i am not that great at it. i want to make
    things very simple. thats why i have started reading books ...
  </p>
  <p>
    So, i started my coding journey in 2023... although my university college
    in CS degree was started in 2021, i pretty much did absolutely nothing for
    like 2-3 years...
  </p>
  <p>
    Obvisouly i am dumb as hell, so i can't understand things unless i see or
    use them...
  </p>
  <p>
    so, when i did start, i always question, why is this? what is this?, dont
    get me wrong, cause i really can't understand shit..
  </p>
  <p>
    This place is where i write my notes, important points... and on the go
    teach how to build things that are so easy yet huge..
  </p>
  <p>
    I have an habit of adding additional dots at the end of statements like
    "so easy yet huge<strong><mark>..</mark></strong>", Hopefully that doesn't bother you..
  </p>

  <p>
    These are the main focus of projects in my head... although none of them
    are started yet. I am gonna update them over the years.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>NOTE: </strong> These projects are not tutorials, cause i dont
    like tutorials, i am gonna write them like i am writing a story book, so
    that they doesn't bore either of us, so everywhere i mention story, you
    can think that as a <strong>story</strong> only... not tutorial <br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>NOTE AGAIN: </strong> I can garentuee you that these projects will
    be completed to a good enough level by
    <strong>2035</strong>
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li id="assembly-story">Assembly (learning grounds)</li>
    <li>C (learning so that we can proceed next step)</li>
    <li>Compiler Design (gonna make our own language)</li>
    <li>
      Operating System (gonna make our own OS (From scratch in our own
      language BTW))
    </li>
    <li>Datastructures (a small detour)</li>
    <li>Database (create a data storing mechanism)</li>
    <li>Game Engine (in our own os, BTW)</li>
    <li>Browser (in out own os, with our own lang, btw)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This all seems like overwhelming and impossible right?, well it is kind of
    impossible, but i am gonna try anyway...
  </p>
  <p>
    Cause you see there is no single place that teaches all these things. Even
    there are some places that teach stuff, it is just that they always assume
    you know something... what ever that something might be...
  </p>
  <p>
    So there stories also assumes something, that is, you have a basic school
    education... (i mean even if you dont have that, its pretty much fine i
    guess.) & a laptopüíª with internet connectivity üåê (must have, i mean what
    are you doing here without them anyway ü§î).
  </p>
  <p>
    I am not web dev, even if i am, i am not gonna focus on readability, user
    experience, UI and all that bullshit.
  </p>
  <p>
    so for simple and yet comfortable use, i keep an index page for every
    story. so keep a tab allocated for that, so that you can access different part of story easily... and rest of the
    tabs can be of content.
  </p>
  <p>I am not good at being an author and english language in general, so expect a lot of spelling mistakes, a lot of
    grammer mistakes, and a lot of
    "this is seriously plain english, he didn't even put a single thought in vocab" situations</p>

  <h4>So, if you think you are ok with all above, you can go ahead start whatever you like.</h4>
  <h4>if you are unsure where to start, start from the first one <strong><span class="marker"><a
          href="#assembly-story">Assembly
          story</a></span></strong></h4>

  <h2>FAQ</h3>
    <h4>Q: Does stories are available in PDF format?</h4>
    <p>NO, not planning on doing as well</p>
    <h4>Q: Does it has light mode?</h4>
    <p>A BIG NO, i cant really work with light mode, so not planning on doing that as well, although its pretty much
      simple just change 2 lines of css and you are good to go</p>
